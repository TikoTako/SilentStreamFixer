### Simple program that "fix" the silent stream bug.

## Overview
This program is a simple workaround for the Silent Stream Bug that affects HDMI audio outputs on certain systems.<br/>
It works by continuously playing a silent 1-second WAV file in a loop, preventing your audio output from going into sleep mode and thus avoiding the bug.

## Features
- **Windows Only**: This program is designed to work on Windows systems only.
- **Icon Tray Visibility**: The program runs in the background and is only visible in the icon tray.
- **Icon Color Indication**: When the program is running, the icon in the tray will have a green background. When it's stopped, the icon will have a red background.

## Installation
The executables are available in a zipped file on the release page. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available. The zipped file is compressed with 7zip. To use the program, just download the zipped file, extract it, and run the executable. No installation is necessary.

## How to Run at Startup
To make this program run at startup, follow these steps:

1. Press `Windows+R` to open the "Run" box.
2. Type `shell:startup` and then press Enter. This will open a File Explorer window right to the "Startup" folder.
3. Create a shortcut to the Silent Stream Bug Fixer executable file inside the "Startup" folder.
