ESL WARNING

So my mobo have a realtek audio but i have the audio output on the intel with the hdmi cable.

When i play some audio file i have sometimes "CLAK" at the start but most times is just silent for around one second.

But when i have something else that is already using the audio there is no delay or "clacks".

After some googling i have found out that is the audio driver that go sleep.

I tried all the suff i found (modify the registry, the power saving settings, different drivers version) for both the realtek and the intel.

Nothing worked...

So i tried to create an empty wav file with Audacity and tried with that open...

Well that work.

So i made this program that just play a silent 1 second wave file in loop.
